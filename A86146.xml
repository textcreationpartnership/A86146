         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe King is much daunted at his removall from Hurſt-Caſtle, although he had no great cauſe to joy in coming thither at all, he wiſheth that he had not ſpent ſo much time in the Treaty, but had without queſtion granted all that was required at once, yet doth in ſeverall Speeches by way of diſcourſe, urge how farre he condeſcended in the Treaty, ſaying further, that he can propound a way to prevent the decay of Trade, recover Ireland, and to do much more to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>His Majeſtie ſeems to relie much upon the hopes he hath of the Prince, and expected the mouldring away of the revolted Ships for want of money, the Prince is yet at the Hague, but is ſhortly to returne to his Queen-Mother in France. Having thus farre ſhewed how the caſe ſtands with the King and the Prince in relation to their owne wayes and apprehenſions, it is neceſſary that there ſhould be ſomwhat ſaid on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, and how the Parliament and Army act and move for a ſpeedy ſettlement of the Kingdome either againſt the King, or without him.</p>
            <p>In doing whereof it is firſt obſervable, that there is a Declaration brought in and will ſhortly paſſe the Houſe, with many grounds and reaſons to ſhew that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:162535:3"/>His Majeſties Conceſſions in the Treaty are unſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and no grounds for a ſetled peace in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: And to prevent delayes in what ſhall follow, and that the Houſe may be unanimous, and proceed with one joynt conſent, none are to be admitted to ſit in the Houſe, but ſuch as do atteſt this Declaration; and as it is neceſſary for the carrying on of this great worke, that there ſhould be no ſidings in Parliament, ſo is it likewiſe in all other Councells, and amongſt publike Officers in Cities and Corporations: and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as this is a time of the yeare for electing ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Officers, the Parliament ſet forth this enſuing Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That his Majeſty being truſted with a limited power to rule according to Law, and by expreſſe Covenant and Oath obliged to preſerve and protect the Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the People, for and by whom he was intruſted, hath perverted that truſt and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed that power, to the hurt and prejudice of the generality, and to the oppreſsion (if not deſtruction) of many of them, and hath raiſed and aſſumed that hurtful power which was never committed to him, to the taking

               <p n="2">2. That the King hath granted Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Prince, as alſo to ORMOND and his aſſociate Iriſh Rebells, which are not recalled to this day.</p>
               <p n="3">3.
